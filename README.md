## Task Description
The first assignment for Software Engineering requires the implementation of a front-end and back-end separated address book, 
which primarily includes three basic functions: first, the contact adding function, which requires adding information such as 
name and phone number, and storing it in the back-end database; second, when modifying contact information, it must be read
from the back-end database, with caching prohibited; finally, when deleting contact information, it must also be processed 
from the back-end database. After completing the basic functions, the project needs to be deployed to a cloud server.
